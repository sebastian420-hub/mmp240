 <h1 id="learn">What is FPV?</h1>

<p>FPV or First Person View is the most unique experience of interacting with your aircraft through a level of immersion that is unparalleled by anything short of virtual reality.  In its most basic form, it takes you, the pilot, and transfers your visual consciousness into the body of a fast, agile, and precise flying machine.  It gives you a whole new and awe inspiring view of the world around you that only those who fly FPV get to experience.  There are really about three different schools of FPV multirotor flying; racing, freestyle, and aerial photography. </p>

<h2 id="learn">Freestyle Flying</h2>
<p id="learnp"> Freestyle flying is all about your environment, your multirotor, and the interaction between the two.  It might be finding that new gap that your multirotor barely fits through, dodging ghost branches as you dance through your local park, finding cool new locations in which to explore, or finally learning that new trick that you saw on someoneâ€™s flight video.  Freestyle is a form of expression in flight, more focused on acrobatics and exploring your environment.  Freestyle also has the added benefit of helping to prepare you for racing by pushing the limits of your multicopter through learning control. As an FPV Beginner, this is most likely where you will start in your journey!</p>  
    
<h2 id="learn">FPV Racing</h2>
    
<p id="learnp">FPV racing consists of flying either solo, or with a group of other pilots, through a series of obstacles, flags, and gates.  As with all racing, the goal is to get first place, either by beating all the other pilots to the finish line or getting the best time on the track.  While this may sound simple at first, most tracks will not only push the limit in terms of speed, but will also test your ability to maneuver your multirotor through all aspects of control.  Many races come down to who has the fastest reflexes and can find the best line in the track.</p>
    
<h2 id="learn">Aerial Photography</h2>
   
<p id="learnp">Aerial photography is just that, viewing and recording whatever your chosen subject matter is from the air.  This is a great way to explore the world around you, and gives you a unique experience of taking your photography literally to a whole new level.  Aerial photography also has many practical uses, such as showing unique views of real estate, area mapping, or even filming movies!</p>
